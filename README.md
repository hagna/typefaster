Typefaster
==========

It took a long time to learn qwerty well enough to cruise along at 70 WPM and
sometimes beat 5 people at typeracer. Learning dvorak for an estimated 20%
improvement in typing speed would take a long time too.  Perhaps a chording
keyboard could be both easier to learn and fast enough to use for regular
typing tasks like blogging.  Research supports the easier to learn idea, so
long as the chording scheme isn't too fancy, like on a stenograph.  This
project aims to produce a chording keyboard on which you can reach 80-90 WPM
after about 50 hours of practice. It will work one handed for about half the
speed and it will be eyes free i.e. you won't have to watch the keys or even
fight the urge to watch the keys.

shift register
