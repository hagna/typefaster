Typefaster
==========

It took a long time to learn qwerty, and learning dvorak would also take a long
time for an estimated 20% improvement in typing speed.  Perhaps a chording
keyboard could be both easier to learn and faster.  Research supports the
easier to learn idea, so long as the chording scheme isn't too fancy like on a
stenograph.  The goal of this project is to type faster (80-90 WPM) with a
chording keyboard after about 50 hours of practice.
